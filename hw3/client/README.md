# How to use template

## Prerequisites
You need to have NodeJS installed in order to use this.

## Getting started
Run in the Terminal

```
npm install

npm start
```

When you have run npm start, the browser opens up on localhost:9000 and every time you change your code within the /src folder the browser refreshes and shows the latest updates

## Limitations

* Unbanning a user is not possible

* When you leave a chatroom / join another one you lose your OP status

* When creating a chatroom you must join it after creating it

* Op's appear both in the list of op's and the list of users

* Cannot send update to chat when user leaves a room

* Clicking on a room item in the roomlist without pressing join creates a room with the title '0'

* When a user is kicked from a room he can still view messages, but not send messages
