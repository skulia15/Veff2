                <p>It all began when Ike Sewell imagined a pizza unlike any other. Fresh dough with a tall edge, topped with homemade sauce and more cheese than you could believe. People have been lining up ever since.</p>

                <p>The Uno story begins in Chicago in 1943 when Ike Sewell developed deep dish pizza and opened a new type of restaurant at the corner of Ohio & Wabash. It was here that Ike served a pizza unlike any that had been served before. Buttery 'out-of-this-world' crust that had a tall edge like a fruit pie. He created a recipe that combined authentic Italian spices and quality tomatoes with more cheese than people could believe and then baked it for nearly an hour. When people tasted it, they wanted more of the same and the lines have been forming ever since to get into the restaurant.</p>

                <hr className="border"/>                
                <p>Uno still draws its identity and inspiration from the artisan heritage of the original Pizzeria Uno in Chicago, IL. Each restaurant still makes their deep dish pizza dough fresh every morning, and our Chicago Thin Crust Pizza is jam-packed with bold flavors. Today, we are as passionate about craft beer as we are our pizza. We work with quality brewers to bring you a selection of some of the best national, regional and local craft beers. After all, nothing goes better together than pizza and beer</p>
